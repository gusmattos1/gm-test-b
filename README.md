This project was developed for a test.

To start run `npm install` and `npm start`

The Google Login will only work if you are running from `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://localhost:3001/`

I didn't fully understand how stocks and trades work, so it was confusing to how to display the data, even more working with live data from the socket that had many price/volume information for the same timestamp. Because of this, I have built two components to display the data. The first, `Dashboard`, I built following the example provided. The second, `New Dashboard` I built to provide the user better options to select the trades and easily change from live and stored data.
